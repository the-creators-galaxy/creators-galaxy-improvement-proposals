# Creators Galaxy Improvement Proposals

## About The Creator's Galaxy

The Creator’s Galaxy is a permissionless and community-governed social ecosystem. The fees, rules, and specifications of the ecosystem can be governed and managed by the ecosystem’s community themselves, with influence weighted by the amount of Calaxy Tokens ($CLXY) being held at the time of a vote. New features, token types, and services can be proposed and added by the community by the definition of a "Creators Galaxy Improvement Proposal" or CGIP.

## What is a CGIP?

A CGIP is a document that specifies potential new features or processes for The Creator's Galaxy. It is by proposing or reviewing a CGIP, making comments and/or proposed edits that others in the community can add their thoughts. Ultimately, a decision will be made on whether to implement the feature proposed by the CGIP in The Creators Galaxy, or not. Over time, the decision on each CGIPs will become more and more decentralized, with the community voting on those decisions weighted by $CLXY token holdings.

## Purpose

The goal of CGIPs is to provide to participants in The Creator's Galaxy  a means by which they can propose new features, and additionally provide and collect community feedback on those proposals, in a single a place where the history of those discussions can be transparently verified in a public forum.

## Process

The CGIP process is documented in [CGIP-1](./CGIP/cgip-1.md).
