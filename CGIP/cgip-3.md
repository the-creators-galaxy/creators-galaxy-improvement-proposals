# Title

2024-2025 Stewards Proposal

# Abstract

According to the Creator’s Galaxy Improvement Proposal #1, which established the Creator’s Galaxy Improvement Proposal Process, the DAO Stewards are subject to a vote every 12 months (at minimum) to ensure that there is a consistent turnover of participants.

Here we propose a set of DAO stewards for 2024-2025.

# Motivation

According to the Creator’s Galaxy Improvement Proposal Process, there is required to be a revote every 12 months. We believe that the authors of this proposal have the best understanding throughout the Hedera and Creators Galaxy communities of what is needed to take the ecosystem forward in the next stage of its evolution and growth. We understand that this is an important topic, and so therefore we aim to clearly articulate our reasoning and inspiration behind the specific choices articulated here.

# About the Authors

Cooper Kunz was an early team member at Hedera, who later joined the Calaxy team as its original Chief Technology Officer. He currently works on the product team at Aztec, a privacy-first Layer-2 for Ethereum. He has over 5+ years of full time experience working in the web3 ecosystem.

Jason Fabritz joined Calaxy as a Senior Software Engineer focusing on creating open source projects for the Creators Galaxy ecosystem. He is additionally the author and maintainer of the Hedera .NET SDK. He has over 20 years of experience building solutions for commercial, government, laboratory and university entities and 3+ years working in the web3 ecosystem.

# Rationale

Revoting every 12 months is a fundamental and key requirement as part of the Creator’s Galaxy Improvement Proposal Process. Here we aim to articulate some of the rationale for this specific configuration or makeup of stewards. Notably, there are two individuals suggested to remain from the previous steward set, who can provide critical insight and knowledge to the new members. It is expected that this is less than ideally 33% carryover, and ideally they do not serve more than 2 terms.

## Things we think that could be improved

1. Increased government involvement
    * Trying to get more community involved with the DAO directly. 
        *  Throughout 2023-2024 there were 0 governance proposals submitted by the DAO directly or by the community, beyond those setting up the DAO
2. More defined vision & product strategy
    * Defining what the creators galaxy protocol is (short term strategy), what it will become (long term strategy), and how anyone can permissonlessly integrate with it 
3. Increased communications  
    * Publishing regular transparency reports that highlight distributions of funds and the contributions of individual stewards, committees, and their members.

## Goals for the 2024-2025 DAO Stewards

1. Prior to March 15, 2025, have executed 25 or more governance proposals, distributing at least 10% but no more than 15% of the total supply of $CLXY to the community for furthering the development of the Creators Galaxy Community and protocol.
    * Such proposals may include, but are not limited to:
        1. Core development of the creator’s galaxy protocol
        2. Ecosystem and market development
        3. 3rd party application integrations
        4. Airdrops and user acquisition strategies

2. Increase Economic Activity for the $CLXY ecosystem
3. Produce quarterly reports summarizing efforts conducted by the stewards and any subcommittees contractors or grantees.
4. Generate a quarterly report disclosing the amounts of $CLXY dispersed from treasury accounts for that quarter and the general nature of the purpose of those disbursements (ie. contractor payments, steward salaries)

# User stories

Traditional user stories do not necessarily apply to this governance proposal, however we’ll aim to articulate some of the roles & responsibilities we see this group of individuals having.

1. Facilitating monthly token distributions out of the DAO multisig treasuries
    * Alternatively developing, auditing, and implementing smart contracts to automate this currently manual process. Any change to a smart contract based distribution model would have to be subject to further governance votes.

2. Defining & delivering on a practical short term (1 year) vision for the Creator’s Galaxy Protocol as an onchain ecosystem for web3 ecosystems and content creators.

# Specification

We propose the following individuals and associated public keys are added to the following Hedera Wallets: 0.0.859877, 0.0.859897, 0.0.859903, and 0.0.859906 in a publicly known key rotation ceremony, as a 3 of 6 multisig.

    You know Patches. He built Turtle Moon, and now works at Swirlds Labs.

## Creation of a marketing subcommittee

Additionally, this proposal suggests the establishment of a marketing subcommittee. This would include full or part time contractors, including potentially previous DAO Stewards, whose primary responsibility would be producing educational material about the ecosystem and increasing its awareness. We consider this as a requirement for the successful evolution of the DAO. The participation and budget of which would need to be agreed upon by the elected stewards. Their roles and responsibilities would include managing social media accounts, memes, and more. This proposal specifically automatically extends an invitation to the following previous stewards to become part of the initial marketing committee, if they choose to accept, which is to be managed by 2024-2025 Stewards Andy & Milan:

* Max Walker Williams
* Rufus Daniel (Zepzi)
* Ashton Addison
* Nick Crypto Crusader

# Steps to Implement

1. Give feedback on this proposal
2. After 7 days, the proposal will be submitted as “live” for voting

  1. This vote will occur on vote.creatorsgalaxyfoundation.com
  2. You will need to have unstacked any $CLXY tokens prior to the voting date in order for the “weight” of your account to be accurately considered. After the initial proposal date and the voting snapshot has been taken, you can then move your tokens back to wherever you please. Your voting weight will be “locked in”
  3. Holders of $CLXY will then have 14 days to vote on this proposal
  4. If passed, the DAO coordinates a key rotation ceremony within 30 days
  5. Please see [CGIP-2](https://github.com/the-creators-galaxy/creators-galaxy-improvement-proposals/blob/main/CGIP/cgip-2.md) for more information on the current voting process

> Note that it is expected this process in total takes a minimum of 28 days.

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal is not fully backwards compatible with the “DAO Stewards'' articulated in Section 4.5.2. of [CGIP-1](https://github.com/the-creators-galaxy/creators-galaxy-improvement-proposals/blob/main/CGIP/cgip-1.md) - it specifically is a follow up on its requirement to revote every 12 months.

## Security Implications

Those ultimately voted in through this proposal are going to collectively manage a series of multisignature accounts on the Hedera network, “stewarding” the DAO treasuries. This means therefore these individuals must be responsible for their personal private key management.

# How to Teach This

Previously the Creator’s Galaxy DAO was managed by a series of 6 individuals that are well respected throughout the Hedera community. Every 12 months, those individuals need to be re-voted and replaced based on the needs of the community at the time. This proposal suggests replacements that have world-class experience building smart contract protocols, open source developer tools, growing crypto native communities, and token economies.

# Rejected Ideas

1. Primarily having marketing & business development focused stewards
    * We believe that the community is fundamentally lacking in technical representation and those with a clear product vision for the $CLXY token and broader Creator’s Galaxy ecosystem.

2. Adding more than 7 stewards
    * This has been rejected because the stewards are able to further give out grants or similar opportunities to various members of the DAO, even if not stewards.
    * Note: We are very much open to suggestions on who to additionally include in order to change this proposal from 3/6 to 4/7!
